# Reporting

This module is responsible for **communicating insights and results** generated by the profiling module.  
It takes outputs from `profiling/` (schema, statistics, quality checks) and produces human-readable summaries and visualizations.

### Key classes

- **EDASummarizer**  
  - Generates **textual summaries** of the data.
  - Can provide high-level insights or detailed column-level descriptions.
  - Could optionally leverage LLMs for natural-language summaries.

- **Visualizer**  
  - Generates **charts, plots, and dashboards** from the profiling output.
  - Supports histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, correlation matrices, and other visualizations.
  - Can produce interactive visualizations for notebooks or dashboards.

- **ReportExporter**  
  - Exports reports in **Image, PDF, or notebook formats**.
  - Combines textual summaries and visualizations into a single report.
  - Makes the results **shareable and presentation-ready**.

### Workflow

1. Profiling module (`SchemaInferer`, `DataProfiler`, `QualityChecker`) analyzes the data and outputs structured schema + metrics.  
2. Reporting module consumes these outputs:
   - `EDASummarizer` creates textual summaries.
   - `Visualizer` creates visual representations.
   - `ReportExporter` combines all outputs into a final report.
3. The report can be viewed in **notebooks, images, or exported formats**, or sent by mail.
